        Hello, my name is Jonathan B. Curtis, I am a physicist studying theoretical quantum many-body physics. Currently I am a postdoctoral researcher at University of California, Los Angeles and before that I was a postdoc at Harvard University. I earned my Ph.D. in August 2020 from the University of Maryland, College Park. My main interests lie at the intersections between condensed matter physics, AMO physics, and quantum information science. I am particularly eager to uncover new quantum phases of materials and show how these may be used to design new and potentially useful devices and technologies.
